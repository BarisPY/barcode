For example 30.12 or 92.25

Example of Correct Use:
BlackTable 4015000090940:120.30

Incorrect Use Case:
Black Table 4015000090940:120.30 (The product name should be written contiguously, BlackTable should be BlackTable instead of Black Coffee Table).
-----------
What the program will understand:

For example; When you type SiyahMasa 4015000090940:120.30, the program understands that when the barcode 4015000090940 is scanned by the camera, it is SiyahMasa and its price is 120.30 TL. If there is no penny in your price, add “.00” at the end if it is an integer. For example 120.00 or 92.00
